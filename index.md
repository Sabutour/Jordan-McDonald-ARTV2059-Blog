## Coding and Craziness
Welcome to the [blog](https://sabutour.github.io/Jordan-McDonald-ARTV2059-Blog/)! This blog details my haphazard and disjointed journey through ARTV2059, and my insights into the projects I'm workong on for the class. Enjoy the read.

# Small Beginnings

I am very excited for this course. An ANU course focusing on Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality? It was geniunely a course I never thought would be available here and I'm thrilled to have gotten in. I'm slightly late on getting to the blog part of this course, but I've been keeping notes throughout the course to toss on here when I had the time to format everything nicely. So, without further ado, let's get started.

The first semester of this course was devoted to Augmented Reality (AR), the process of overlaying a digital image, render, or effect onto a video feed of a real world location. Such as making a digital mug appear on a table in the kitchen, or a picture over a picture frame. There are lots of possible use cases both for artistic and practical purposes.

Our first task in this semester was to work with Vuforia, a software that allows images to be uploaded, analysed, and recognised. When paired with the Unity Game Engine as an addon package, you can quite simply make a program that recognises an uploaded image and does basically _anything_ with it. Neat! For our simple task, I kept it simple and made a quick little program that would recognise a specific trading card, and make the card's artwork appear as an overlay floating on top of the card. As if it were popping out of the card itself.

I had some conceptual ideas for making the card art float on top vertically and rotate, or to even grab a 3D model that would stand on the card, but all of these ideas seemed like too much for what is supposed to be a quick and easy demonstration of the software to build our understanding.

# Journey Through Midjourney

AI is a bit of a buzzword these days, used more for marketing than anything approaching some sort of conscious, living intelligence. But that doesn't mean it hasn't paved the way for some pretty incredible new technologies recently. Perhaps the most _visually_ engaging of which is the releases of new image-generating AI such as [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/). These programs are trained on huge sample sets of artwords (Is that ethical? Hard to [say](https://kotaku.com/ai-art-dall-e-midjourney-stable-diffusion-copyright-1849388060)) to generate basically any artwork when given a prompt. Such as the examples shown below, generated by myself.

_Prompt: watercolor sketches of beautiful landscapes, parchment, detailed, forest, watercolor sketch_

_Prompt: A monolithic stone tower in a sea of visions, cthonic, dark rock, sea of memory, concept art_

As someone without a shred of artisitc talent, this tech is incredibly intruging and exciting. I don't believe it is a replacement for traditional artwork, in the same way that giving everyone a smartphone camera doesn't mean that film-makers are no longer relevant (Take that Spielburg). But rather I see this as a new and emerging tool that will change the landscape in some way. I definitely wanted to use this tech in one of my projects in some way. 

# Use of Augmented Reality in Museums

I came across [this](https://jasoren.com/how-to-use-augmented-reality-in-museums-examples-and-use-cases/) article in my resarch as to applications of AR. One idea that inspired me, perhaps informed by my recent experiments using Midjourney, was how it could be used to augment or replace museum audio tours. I've used pre-recorded audio tours in museums in the past, and found them lacking. They were often finicky to use, the headphones were low quality, and in one case I was given a recording in the wrong language. Clearly with the versatility of modern smartphones, there is room for improvement and innovation in this space. Some museums have moved to use apps to provide information but others such as [The Cleveland Musuem of Art](https://www.clevelandart.org/) has taken it a step further with augmented reality. 

Their exhibitions as part of their ARTLENS Gallery explore numerous ways to apply augmented reality and digital technology to create interactive experiences, a way to further connect with the works on display. This [video](https://youtu.be/XYRjaZl08lQ) shows off some of their really cool displays. 

I'm not going to just copy the text in these articles and links, but in general, AR can be a way to provide further information and context to a display piece in a way that complements the display, or can be part of the exhibit itself, bringing the viewer in as an active participant in the work.

# Artist's Work - _Mythos_ and _Heroes_ by Stephen Fry

I'm not _quite_ sure if this counts as acceptable as a reference, but it did inform and inspire my projects. Stephen Fry is a well-known public figure. Author, actor, general intellectual. I have a great deal of respect for Fry, and his way to tell stories in an engaging and imaginative way. Recently, I've been reading his trilogy of books that retell the stories of Greek Mythology as _stories_ rather than just as historical texts and essays. Whilst he has several citations that go into further detail, and provide an analytic lens over his writing, the stories themselves are conversational, informal, as if being told like a bedtime story. And they are incredibly engaging in this format. Greek Mythology has always been of interest to me, and this framework has allowed me to re-explore this interest and make it something I wish to use in my Creative Image Target work. Combined with the research into museum AR work, I am beginning work on what I am calling Project Tales. (I like giving my work little project names).
