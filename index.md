## Coding and Craziness
Welcome to the [blog](https://sabutour.github.io/Jordan-McDonald-ARTV2059-Blog/)! This blog details my haphazard and disjointed journey through ARTV2059, and my insights into the projects I'm workong on for the class. Enjoy the read.

# Small Beginnings

I am very excited for this course. An ANU course focusing on Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality? It was geniunely a course I never thought would be available here and I'm thrilled to have gotten in. I'm slightly late on getting to the blog part of this course, but I've been keeping notes throughout the course to toss on here when I had the time to format everything nicely. So, without further ado, let's get started.

The first semester of this course was devoted to Augmented Reality (AR), the process of overlaying a digital image, render, or effect onto a video feed of a real world location. Such as making a digital mug appear on a table in the kitchen, or a picture over a picture frame. There are lots of possible use cases both for artistic and practical purposes.

Our first task in this semester was to work with Vuforia, a software that allows images to be uploaded, analysed, and recognised. When paired with the Unity Game Engine as an addon package, you can quite simply make a program that recognises an uploaded image and does basically _anything_ with it. Neat! For our simple task, I kept it simple and made a quick little program that would recognise a specific trading card, and make the card's artwork appear as an overlay floating on top of the card. As if it were popping out of the card itself.

I had some conceptual ideas for making the card art float on top vertically and rotate, or to even grab a 3D model that would stand on the card, but all of these ideas seemed like too much for what is supposed to be a quick and easy demonstration of the software to build our understanding.

# Journey Through Midjourney

AI is a bit of a buzzword these days, used more for marketing than anything approaching some sort of conscious, living intelligence. But that doesn't mean it hasn't paved the way for some pretty incredible new technologies recently. Perhaps the most _visually_ engaging of which is the releases of new image-generating AI such as [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/). These programs are trained on huge sample sets of artwords (Is that ethical? Hard to [say](https://kotaku.com/ai-art-dall-e-midjourney-stable-diffusion-copyright-1849388060)) to generate basically any artwork when given a prompt. Such as the examples shown below, generated by myself.

_Prompt: watercolor sketches of beautiful landscapes, parchment, detailed, forest, watercolor sketch_

_Prompt: A monolithic stone tower in a sea of visions, cthonic, dark rock, sea of memory, concept art_

_Prompt: ice glacier, concept art_

As someone without a shred of artisitc talent, this tech is incredibly intruging and exciting. I don't believe it is a replacement for traditional artwork, in the same way that giving everyone a smartphone camera doesn't mean that film-makers are no longer relevant (Take that Spielburg). But rather I see this as a new and emerging tool that will change the landscape in some way. I definitely wanted to use this tech in one of my projects in some way. 

# Use of Augmented Reality in Museums

I came across [this](https://jasoren.com/how-to-use-augmented-reality-in-museums-examples-and-use-cases/) article in my resarch as to applications of AR. One idea that inspired me, perhaps informed by my recent experiments using Midjourney, was how it could be used to augment or replace museum audio tours. I've used pre-recorded audio tours in museums in the past, and found them lacking. They were often finicky to use, the headphones were low quality, and in one case I was given a recording in the wrong language. Clearly with the versatility of modern smartphones, there is room for improvement and innovation in this space. Some museums have moved to use apps to provide information but others such as [The Cleveland Musuem of Art](https://www.clevelandart.org/) has taken it a step further with augmented reality. 

Their exhibitions as part of their ARTLENS Gallery explore numerous ways to apply augmented reality and digital technology to create interactive experiences, a way to further connect with the works on display. This [video](https://youtu.be/XYRjaZl08lQ) shows off some of their really cool displays. 

I'm not going to just copy the text in these articles and links, but in general, AR can be a way to provide further information and context to a display piece in a way that complements the display, or can be part of the exhibit itself, bringing the viewer in as an active participant in the work.

# Artist's Work - _Mythos_ and _Heroes_ by Stephen Fry

I'm not _quite_ sure if this counts as acceptable as a reference, but it did inform and inspire my projects. Stephen Fry is a well-known public figure. Author, actor, general intellectual. I have a great deal of respect for Fry, and his way to tell stories in an engaging and imaginative way. Recently, I've been reading his trilogy of books that retell the stories of Greek Mythology as _stories_ rather than just as historical texts and essays. Whilst he has several citations that go into further detail, and provide an analytic lens over his writing, the stories themselves are conversational, informal, as if being told like a bedtime story. And they are incredibly engaging in this format. Greek Mythology has always been of interest to me, and this framework has allowed me to re-explore this interest and make it something I wish to use in my Creative Image Target work. Combined with the research into museum AR work, I am beginning work on what I am calling Project Tales. (I like giving my work little project names). 

# Project Tales - Part 1

Welcome to Project Tales, my foray into more involved image target projects. My concept is as follows, re-examining and re-exploring Greek Mythological tales and presenting them in a new light. How could these tales be reconsidered when viewed through a fresh lens?

This project begins with Midjourney. Consider the story of Hades and Persephone, Greek Mythology's somehow most stable relationship despite it beginning with kidnapping. These characters have had numerous visual interpretations and written retellings such that there is no one definitive depiction of them. So, I was curious what an AI like Midjourney would create if given an open-ended prompt about them. To take the result out of my hands and place it into something who's understanding of the subject material is an unknown quanitity. What would it create?

I plugged a few different stories into the AI. Hades and Persephone's love story, Prometheus' theft of divine fire and Icarus' tragic flight and fall. I figured these stories would be diverse enough to create interesting visual results, but also well-known enough tales. 

So what did we end up with? Let's start with Hades and Persphone. 

![Image](https://i.imgur.com/dW1Hbbd.png)

This image is striking and I adore how it came out. The prompt used was simply _hades and persephone, fantasy_ and this image has an ethereal quality to it. The two figures are simultaneously people and not people, seemingly made out of the environment around them. Hades is in shadow compared to Persephone, his face a silhouette and his mouth seemingly in a kissing expression. Persephone is brigher, her face looks like a rose, flower of love and a nod to her being a goddess of Spring (daughter of Demeter, goddess of the harvest and of agriculture). Around them both are branches and vines. Above the blue and green of a lit canopy. Below is fire and flame, clinging to them as if to drag them both down into the underworld. There is a lot here to explore from an artistic standpoint. It's a piece that could be on display in a museum by itself. 

What about the Theft of Fire?

![Image](https://i.imgur.com/xsOj02u.png)

This one is a little more abstract. But there's still a lot here to sink out teeth into. For context, Prometheus stole divine fire from Mount Olympus and gave it to humanity so that they could thrive. This was expressly forbidden by Zeus. Prometheus was punished by beinng chained to a rock and for a bird to come and eat his liver while he was conscious. The liver would grow back and the punishment would repeat for eternity. Brutal.

Here the form of someone suffering can be clearly seen. The blue fire, distinguishing it from regular fire, surrounds his, tying it to the story and perhaps as part of his prison. His face seems to be either shrouded by it or represented by it. His form is writhing and contorted. Overall, not a pleasant scene. But a striking one.

Finally, poor Icarus.

![Image](https://i.imgur.com/17vHNFG.png)

A beautiful sky belies a tragic fate. The flaming wings disintergrating around Icarus as he falls to his death, like feathers from a dying bird. What appears to be his arm reaching up trying to grasp for something to save him. The serene sky around him, ignorant or callous of his self-inflicted fate. The Greek's loved their cautionary tales around pride, ignorance and not listening to advice.

Anyway, this is part one of this project. I have these images, artworks made by an AI intepreting ancient tales through a new lens. An example of history being observed by an outsider. Next up, how to augment them as image targets in augmented reality.

# Project Tales - Part 2

Let me tell you the tale (get it?) of this project's journey to completion. 

After importing the Midjourney images into a 2D plane in Unity, it was a matter of _what_ to do with them. Inspired by my research into museums, I imagined these artworks on the wall in a gallery. What would I want to show? I had several concepts. These included:

- Show related artworks.
- Show QR codes linking to more information.
- Excerpts from the story the artwork is related to.
- Audio related to the story. 
- Animated overlays to make the image move.
- Etc.

In the interests of time, scale, and my sanity, I did not do all of these. For this project, I opted to include excerpts of the stories (Taken from Stephen Fry's _Mythos_ and _Heroes_ books, bringing it all full circle) and audio related to these scenes. 

![Image](https://i.imgur.com/TQNJBgc.png)

My original plan was to have the text in large boxes around the artwork, so as to not cover it up. But this had a very flat feeling to it, and gave me too much room to too much excerpt. I wanted small snapshots, glimpses into the story, not the whole tale. To emphasize the three-dimensional nature of AR, I layered the excerpts on top of the image in small snippets. 

I had some technical challenges doing this. The project's scope was simple and within my skillset, but I had a couple of things I hadn't done before. I used [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A33HoKdOhTQ) tutorial to add custom fonts that were usable as 3D text, which worked like a charm.

Besides that, I had a very odd bug in which the text on top of the transparent planes would appear faded and dim. This seemed to be a rendering bug which would draw the text behind the panel even though it was above it. [This](https://answers.unity.com/questions/609021/how-to-fix-transparent-rendering-problem.html) user guide helped me fix the problem my manually adjusting the rendering order. Never would have figured that out on my own.

![Image](https://i.imgur.com/PCMM57u.png)

As for the audio, I went two different routes. For the **Theft of Fire** and **The Flight of Icarus**, I used diagetic, environmental sounds. The sound of blistering winds from high above, and the sound of crackling fire. Both of these sounds came from [Freesound](https://freesound.org/).

For Hades and Persephone, I took a different route. There's a lovely jazzy musical called [Hadestown](https://www.hadestown.com/) that tells the story of Orpheus and Euridice's love story. It also features a song in the musical called _Epic III ("They danced...)_ which tells of Hades of Persephone's love. I thought it was a fitting instrumental piece for this. It was full of emotion and significance, which is what I wanted to convey. I took this instrumental piece and used it to layer over the artwork.

I'm very proud of Project Tales, or as it now could be told, Reinterpeting Myths Through a Digital Lens.

# Artist's Work - Access Mars

One of the most humanitarian concepts for virtual reality, to me, is to allow people to experience and see wondrous places they might not have been able to visit otherwise. To take someone to all the wonders of the world in the same day. Virtual reality is more adept for this task specifically because it allows a true sense of scale to be conveyed. Seeing a picture of the Eiffel Tower does not convey it's height like standing next to it in a virtual reality space. This is a phenomenon I have experienced myself.

And perhaps there is not place more wondrous and hardest to visit then other planets and stars. It is very unlikely that any of us alive will visit Mars. But that doesn't mean we can't get a taste. Google, in conujunction with the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) have created a [web VR project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMLD0Lp0JBg) that takes images captured by the Curiousity Mars Rover and projects them into a 360 degree space. Along with little notes and tidbits about the rover and the project. I think this is a great way to bring space to the masses in a way that lets them experience it firsthand. in a small way.
