# Week 1 - Getting Started

I’m excited for this course. I’m lucky enough to say that this isn’t my first rodeo with Arduino’s and the like. It’s my second rodeo, that’s like a 100% increase in experience, right? I’m sure that’s how that works.

So, for my first blog post I figured I’d collate some resources I’m already familiar with, why they’re useful, and what I’m using them for. Sound good? Let’s get to it.

So, I’ve gone through quite a few code editors and IDEs in my time. While I’ve had good use in the past with the likes of [Atom](https://atom.io/), [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) and others, I’ve settled on [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as my editor of choice. It’s fast, customisable, has a ton of useful extensions and available basically everywhere. And it’s been thoroughly tested by many much much more experienced coders for years. And it has extensions to make it play nicely with the Arduino code software! All good points.

So, that’s the code editor sorted, what next? For me, when doing any sort of coding project that’s either solo or group-based, version control software is non-negotiable. It’s mission critical to have access to old versions of code, and backups. For that, like many people, I use [GitHub](github.com). I have experience with it from previous code projects, it integrates nicely with Visual Studio Code, and it has saved my code more than once. May it serve me well again for this course. And, it lets me set up this blog! The one you're reading now! Wild.

So that’s all the code taken care of, but how do we go about building our devices? Throwing some wires together and praying is all well and good, but it’s good to avoid permanently damaging all our precious components. In the past, I’ve used [TinkerCAD](tinkercad.com) as a pretty decent online Arduino wiring and code simulator. Build a circuit, upload some code, see if it works as expected! Useful! It doesn’t solve every use case, and it’s not perfect, but it can really help for testing and to share circuit diagrams quickly.

So, those are the main tools that’ll be getting me through this class! Let’s get to it.

# Week 4 - Assignment 1 Project Proposal

When I bought an Arduino starter kit (specifically the "[ELEGOO MEGA 2560 THE MOST COMPLETE STARTER KIT](https://www.amazon.com.au/ELEGOO-Complete-Ultimate-Tutorial-Mega2560/dp/B01EWNUUUA)"), my options as to what I could actually make were drastically expanded. Of the many materials included in the kit, the ones that drew my attention most immediately were the Membrane Keypad and the RFID scanner. In this digital world, inputs such as these are routinely used for security devices like safes and door locks.
