# Coding and Craziness
Welcome to the [blog](https://sabutour.github.io/Jordan-McDonald-ARTV2059-Blog/)! This blog details my haphazard and disjointed journey through ARTV2059, and my insights into the projects I'm workong on for the class. Enjoy the read.

# Basic Image Target - Small Beginnings

I am very excited for this course. An ANU course focusing on Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality? It was geniunely a course I never thought would be available here and I'm thrilled to have gotten in. I'm slightly late on getting to the blog part of this course, but I've been keeping notes throughout the course to toss on here when I had the time to format everything nicely. So, without further ado, let's get started.

The first semester of this course was devoted to Augmented Reality (AR), the process of overlaying a digital image, render, or effect onto a video feed of a real world location. Such as making a digital mug appear on a table in the kitchen, or a picture over a picture frame. There are lots of possible use cases both for artistic and practical purposes.

Our first task in this semester was to work with Vuforia, a software that allows images to be uploaded, analysed, and recognised. When paired with the Unity Game Engine as an addon package, you can quite simply make a program that recognises an uploaded image and does basically _anything_ with it. Neat! For our simple task, I kept it simple and made a quick little program that would recognise a specific trading card, and make the card's artwork appear as an overlay floating on top of the card. As if it were popping out of the card itself.

![Image](https://i.imgur.com/QJfKK2N.png)

I had some conceptual ideas for making the card art float on top vertically and rotate, or to even grab a 3D model that would stand on the card, but all of these ideas seemed like too much for what is supposed to be a quick and easy demonstration of the software to build our understanding.

# Journey Through Midjourney

AI is a bit of a buzzword these days, used more for marketing than anything approaching some sort of conscious, living intelligence. But that doesn't mean it hasn't paved the way for some pretty incredible new technologies recently. Perhaps the most _visually_ engaging of which is the releases of new image-generating AI such as [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/). These programs are trained on huge sample sets of artwords (Is that ethical? Hard to [say](https://kotaku.com/ai-art-dall-e-midjourney-stable-diffusion-copyright-1849388060)) to generate basically any artwork when given a prompt. Such as the examples shown below, generated by myself.

![Image](https://i.imgur.com/38ZkMjE.png)
_Prompt: watercolor sketches of beautiful landscapes, parchment, detailed, forest, watercolor sketch_

![Image](https://i.imgur.com/1lwCt6T.png)
_Prompt: A monolithic stone tower in a sea of visions, cthonic, dark rock, sea of memory, concept art_

![Image](https://i.imgur.com/dOZCb9r.png)
_Prompt: ice glacier, concept art_

As someone without a shred of artisitc talent, this tech is incredibly intruging and exciting. I don't believe it is a replacement for traditional artwork, in the same way that giving everyone a smartphone camera doesn't mean that film-makers are no longer relevant (Take that Spielburg). But rather I see this as a new and emerging tool that will change the landscape in some way. I definitely wanted to use this tech in one of my projects in some way. 

# Use of Augmented Reality in Museums

I came across [this](https://jasoren.com/how-to-use-augmented-reality-in-museums-examples-and-use-cases/) article in my resarch as to applications of AR. One idea that inspired me, perhaps informed by my recent experiments using Midjourney, was how it could be used to augment or replace museum audio tours. I've used pre-recorded audio tours in museums in the past, and found them lacking. They were often finicky to use, the headphones were low quality, and in one case I was given a recording in the wrong language. Clearly with the versatility of modern smartphones, there is room for improvement and innovation in this space. Some museums have moved to use apps to provide information but others such as [The Cleveland Musuem of Art](https://www.clevelandart.org/) has taken it a step further with augmented reality. 

Their exhibitions as part of their ARTLENS Gallery explore numerous ways to apply augmented reality and digital technology to create interactive experiences, a way to further connect with the works on display. This [video](https://youtu.be/XYRjaZl08lQ) shows off some of their really cool displays. 

I'm not going to just copy the text in these articles and links, but in general, AR can be a way to provide further information and context to a display piece in a way that complements the display, or can be part of the exhibit itself, bringing the viewer in as an active participant in the work.

# Artist's Work - _Mythos_ and _Heroes_ by Stephen Fry

![Image](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/811PFai18oL.jpg)

![Image](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91SIlyyZSoL.jpg)
I'm not _quite_ sure if this counts as acceptable as a reference, but it did inform and inspire my projects. Stephen Fry is a well-known public figure. Author, actor, general intellectual. I have a great deal of respect for Fry, and his way to tell stories in an engaging and imaginative way. Recently, I've been reading his trilogy of books that retell the stories of Greek Mythology as _stories_ rather than just as historical texts and essays. Whilst he has several citations that go into further detail, and provide an analytic lens over his writing, the stories themselves are conversational, informal, as if being told like a bedtime story. And they are incredibly engaging in this format. Greek Mythology has always been of interest to me, and this framework has allowed me to re-explore this interest and make it something I wish to use in my Creative Image Target work. Combined with the research into museum AR work, I am beginning work on what I am calling Project Tales. (I like giving my work little project names). 

# Creative Image Target - Project Tales - Part 1

Welcome to Project Tales, my foray into more involved image target projects. My concept is as follows, re-examining and re-exploring Greek Mythological tales and presenting them in a new light. How could these tales be reconsidered when viewed through a fresh lens?

This project begins with Midjourney. Consider the story of Hades and Persephone, Greek Mythology's somehow most stable relationship despite it beginning with kidnapping. These characters have had numerous visual interpretations and written retellings such that there is no one definitive depiction of them. So, I was curious what an AI like Midjourney would create if given an open-ended prompt about them. To take the result out of my hands and place it into something who's understanding of the subject material is an unknown quanitity. What would it create?

I plugged a few different stories into the AI. Hades and Persephone's love story, Prometheus' theft of divine fire and Icarus' tragic flight and fall. I figured these stories would be diverse enough to create interesting visual results, but also well-known enough tales. 

So what did we end up with? Let's start with Hades and Persphone. 

![Image](https://i.imgur.com/dW1Hbbd.png)

This image is striking and I adore how it came out. The prompt used was simply _hades and persephone, fantasy_ and this image has an ethereal quality to it. The two figures are simultaneously people and not people, seemingly made out of the environment around them. Hades is in shadow compared to Persephone, his face a silhouette and his mouth seemingly in a kissing expression. Persephone is brigher, her face looks like a rose, flower of love and a nod to her being a goddess of Spring (daughter of Demeter, goddess of the harvest and of agriculture). Around them both are branches and vines. Above the blue and green of a lit canopy. Below is fire and flame, clinging to them as if to drag them both down into the underworld. There is a lot here to explore from an artistic standpoint. It's a piece that could be on display in a museum by itself. 

What about the Theft of Fire?

![Image](https://i.imgur.com/xsOj02u.png)

This one is a little more abstract. But there's still a lot here to sink out teeth into. For context, Prometheus stole divine fire from Mount Olympus and gave it to humanity so that they could thrive. This was expressly forbidden by Zeus. Prometheus was punished by beinng chained to a rock and for a bird to come and eat his liver while he was conscious. The liver would grow back and the punishment would repeat for eternity. Brutal.

Here the form of someone suffering can be clearly seen. The blue fire, distinguishing it from regular fire, surrounds his, tying it to the story and perhaps as part of his prison. His face seems to be either shrouded by it or represented by it. His form is writhing and contorted. Overall, not a pleasant scene. But a striking one.

Finally, poor Icarus.

![Image](https://i.imgur.com/17vHNFG.png)

A beautiful sky belies a tragic fate. The flaming wings disintergrating around Icarus as he falls to his death, like feathers from a dying bird. What appears to be his arm reaching up trying to grasp for something to save him. The serene sky around him, ignorant or callous of his self-inflicted fate. The Greek's loved their cautionary tales around pride, ignorance and not listening to advice.

Anyway, this is part one of this project. I have these images, artworks made by an AI intepreting ancient tales through a new lens. An example of history being observed by an outsider. Next up, how to augment them as image targets in augmented reality.

# Creative Image Target - Project Tales - Part 2

Let me tell you the tale (get it?) of this project's journey to completion. 

After importing the Midjourney images into a 2D plane in Unity, it was a matter of _what_ to do with them. Inspired by my research into museums, I imagined these artworks on the wall in a gallery. What would I want to show? I had several concepts. These included:

- Show related artworks.
- Show QR codes linking to more information.
- Excerpts from the story the artwork is related to.
- Audio related to the story. 
- Animated overlays to make the image move.
- Etc.

In the interests of time, scale, and my sanity, I did not do all of these. For this project, I opted to include excerpts of the stories (Taken from Stephen Fry's _Mythos_ and _Heroes_ books, bringing it all full circle) and audio related to these scenes. 

![Image](https://i.imgur.com/TQNJBgc.png)

My original plan was to have the text in large boxes around the artwork, so as to not cover it up. But this had a very flat feeling to it, and gave me too much room to too much excerpt. I wanted small snapshots, glimpses into the story, not the whole tale. To emphasize the three-dimensional nature of AR, I layered the excerpts on top of the image in small snippets. 

I had some technical challenges doing this. The project's scope was simple and within my skillset, but I had a couple of things I hadn't done before. I used [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A33HoKdOhTQ) tutorial to add custom fonts that were usable as 3D text, which worked like a charm.

Besides that, I had a very odd bug in which the text on top of the transparent planes would appear faded and dim. This seemed to be a rendering bug which would draw the text behind the panel even though it was above it. [This](https://answers.unity.com/questions/609021/how-to-fix-transparent-rendering-problem.html) user guide helped me fix the problem my manually adjusting the rendering order. Never would have figured that out on my own.

![Image](https://i.imgur.com/PCMM57u.png)

As for the audio, I went two different routes. For the **Theft of Fire** and **The Flight of Icarus**, I used diagetic, environmental sounds. The sound of blistering winds from high above, and the sound of crackling fire. Both of these sounds came from [Freesound](https://freesound.org/).

For Hades and Persephone, I took a different route. There's a lovely jazzy musical called [Hadestown](https://www.hadestown.com/) that tells the story of Orpheus and Euridice's love story. It also features a song in the musical called _Epic III ("They danced...)_ which tells of Hades of Persephone's love. I thought it was a fitting instrumental piece for this. It was full of emotion and significance, which is what I wanted to convey. I took this instrumental piece and used it to layer over the artwork.

I'm very proud of Project Tales, or as it now could be told, Reinterpeting Myths Through a Digital Lens. 

# Artist's Work - Kurzgesagt - In a Nutshell

The Apollo program was the NASA space program that first put a human on the Moon. The Artmeis program seeks to do the same in the modern era. So, it makes total sense in my mind to go from Greek gods to _[space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1Sq1Nr58hM)_. Space is just awesome, unknowable, and amazing. There is so much about it that is fascinating and utterly incomprehensible. 

![Image](https://images7.alphacoders.com/116/1163218.png)

One group out there that makes incredibly accessible and utterly beautiful videos exploring space (as well as _many_ other topics of interest) is the design group and YouTube channel [Kurzgesagt](https://www.youtube.com/@kurzgesagt). They make very pretty and well-informed videos that teach their viewers about all sorts of stuff. Their [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFs4vir_WsTwEd-nJgVJCZPNL3HALHHpF) on "The Universe and Space Stuff" is a constant source of inspiration and wonder to me. I cannot recommend their work (or their merch) highly enough and recommend anyone with a passing interest in space, ants, dinosaurs, sociology, or anyone who needs an [existential crisis](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFs4vir_WsTxontcYm5ctqp89cNBJKNrs) to take a look. Or to binge their entire back catalog. 

So, relevance. For next project, I wanted to explore space in some way. A place we can't really go right now, but that everyone should experience. According to the [overview effect](https://www.businessinsider.com/overview-effect-nasa-apollo8-perspective-awareness-space-2015-8), seeing Earth from space can reshift a person's entire perspective closer towards humanism and kindness. We could use that.

# Exploded View - Project Stellar - Part 1

The scope for this project is only small. Nothing major. It's only

![Image](https://media.tenor.com/dn9TsELSZyUAAAAC/the-power-of-the-sun-in-the-palm-of-my-hand-doctor-octopus.gif)

Okay so that sounds like a lot, but let's back track. For the Exploded View project, we have to create some sort of creatively interpreted exploded view of _something_.

![Image](https://www.designingbuildings.co.uk/w/images/a/ae/Explodedview.jpg)
_General exploded view CAD Drawing_

As it says in the Wattle: 

_Think of all the components that make up the subject matter you choose to work with. You can take various approaches and think technically or creatively about this concept. It doesn’t need to be a conventional diagram, for example, perhaps it is a product and you can represent the supply chain that went into making it? Or is it a space that has memories and stories embedded in it?_

So, creative interpretation. My concept for this is the following: A representation of the Solar System, with the ability to be scaled from small enough to have it in my hand, or big enough to walk around the planets in their enormity. To see the Solar System exploded up to giant scale. To achieve this, I'll need a MVP (Minimum Viable Product). So, let's break this down to core goals and stretch goals. 

### Core Goals

- All of the planets in the Solar System, plus the Sun, correctly scaled to one another.
- The planets spinning on the spot.
- The Sun as a souce of light glowing in the centre.

### Stretch Goals

- The planets to spin on the spot for the correct length of time (involves relative time scaling).
- Planets actually orbitting the sun.
- Moons orbiting planets (at least Earth's Moon).
- Audio for the planets when close.
- Ability to change speed.
- Ability to change size of planets.

So, that's quite a jump from Project Tales, but it'll be a good time and there's more time alloted for this project. To start, let's focus on the planets themselves. To make them will be easy, they're spheres. Or close enough to sphere's for this project. I don't have the skills to texture them but thankfully [Solar System Scope](https://www.solarsystemscope.com/textures/) has textures of all the planets, plus the sun, freely avaiable. Amazing. 

For the planets spinning, I do want their day/night cycles to be correct. So to get the times right, I'll be using [this](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/days/en/#:~:text=Earth%20takes%2024%20hours%20to,and%20Neptune%20takes%2016%20hours) reference alongside eithers to devise a system.

# Exploded View - Project Stellar - Part 2

Time for some Unity stuff!

![Image](https://i.imgur.com/tpJWDXG.png)

I've been hard at work getting a solar system together. Right now, it's to scale, so each planet is scaled correctly relative to the Sun. The image above makes it difficult to see, but Earth and the other terrestrial planets are there. Here's another angle.

![Image](https://i.imgur.com/qEMRmYU.png)

Thanks to [this](https://vionixstudio.com/2022/02/21/how-to-create-a-glow-effect-in-unity/) tutorial and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkPe1hxOmbI) tutorial and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oa6kW5HhRd4) tutorial, I was able to get the sun to glow as intended, which I think really helps elevate the scene.

Just a quick update today.

# Exploded View - Project Stellar - Part 3

This update will be about scripting mostly. It's probably (read: definitely) a mess but it's where I'm going.

To make the planets spin, I thought about using keyframe animation but it seemed much easier to just use some small scripts.

Here's a snippet of the code that makes the Sun spin.

```
transform.Rotate (0, -0.55555555555f*Time.delta) / GlobalVariables.globalTimeScale, 0); 
```

Why the weird number? Because that's what the math works out to to make the Sun rotate in scale. defaultTimeScale is, by default, 3600f which is the number of seconds in an hour. I did the initial calculation on hours per day.

As for GlobalVariables, that's a seprarate script I used to keep track of a bunch of things. Here.

```
public class GlobalVariables : MonoBehaviour
{
    // 1 Day = 1 Minute = 2.5f
    // Real Time = 3600f

        public float speed = 1f;
        public float defaultTimeScale = 3600f;
        public static float globalTimeScale;

    public void Start () {
        globalTimeScale = defaultTimeScale / speed;
    }
    public void changeSpeed(float newSpeed) 
{
    Debug.Log("Updating Speed to " + newSpeed);
    speed = newSpeed;
}
```

Lots of numbers and stuff.

My solution I came up with for making the other planets spin was not very efficient. I have gave one a unique script that would make it rotate on the spot at the correct rate. I didn't want to go searching for specific GameObjects.

Also, with the GlobalVariables script, I can speed up and slow down the rate of spin.

I also got the planets to orbit the Sun by placing an invisible sphere inside of the centre of the sun and attaching the planet to it as a child. By spinning the sphere in the middle of the sun at the rate it would take the planet to orbit the sun, the planet follows the spinning sphere. Genius.

![Image](https://i.imgur.com/4UAUhlm.png)
_See the little green sphere in the sun? That's attatched to Jupiter_

I've currently got all the planets spinning as they should be. Even added a little friend!

![Image](https://i.imgur.com/Rpr5QA5.png)
_Earth and it's little buddy_

My next steps are to get this built onto my phone and run it for real. I'm coding on a MacBook and I have an iPhone so I'll be using XCode to get it over.

# Exploded View - Project Stellar - Part 4

BEHOLD! 

![Image](https://i.imgur.com/IW6cdhQ.png)

The power of the sun in the palm of my hand!

It works on my phone. I had some small issues with XCode, mostly waiting for many gigabytes of updates to complete. 

I decided to make it a [spawnable object](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/placing-and-manipulating-objects-in-ar#605103a5edbc2a6c32bf5661) that appears on a surface when the surface is tapped on. I also added a little script to the Sun that disables the Spawn Manager and the plane renderer once the it is placed so that you can't spawn in multiple solar systems. I had a small problem with the prefab disappearing when the camera isn't close enough but that turned out to be an [easy fix](https://answers.unity.com/questions/157604/objects-disappear-when-too-far-away.html).

# Exploded View - Project Stellar - Part 5

The final update for this project. I've been working on making a quick UI to allow the user to adjust the solar system once it is spawned in. The size of it, the speed at which the planets spin and orbit, from real time to _very_ fast. I also added a slider to adjust the height of the solar system as it for accessibilty. As it gets larger it might clip with a floor so raising it was a neat solution. 

![Image](https://i.imgur.com/JyYq8Wk.png)

I also made some adjustments based on class feedback. To better fit the Exploded View theme, I have changed it from a psudeo-accurate representation of the Solar System to a Galactic Atom. With the sun at the centre, like the nucleus of an atom, the planets now orbit it much like electrons. I liked the idea of using something so large to represent something so tiny, or something so tiny to show something so large. Gravitational orbit sort of works at all scales and so seeing how the universe is almost the same at different scales I thought was neat. 

Anyway, that's enough of AR. Time for VR.

# Artist's Work - Access Mars

One of the most humanitarian concepts for virtual reality, to me, is to allow people to experience and see wondrous places they might not have been able to visit otherwise. To take someone to all the wonders of the world in the same day. Virtual reality is more adept for this task specifically because it allows a true sense of scale to be conveyed. Seeing a picture of the Eiffel Tower does not convey it's height like standing next to it in a virtual reality space. This is a phenomenon I have experienced myself.

And perhaps there is not place more wondrous and hardest to visit then other planets and stars. It is very unlikely that any of us alive will visit Mars. But that doesn't mean we can't get a taste. Google, in conujunction with the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) have created a [web VR project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMLD0Lp0JBg) that takes images captured by the Curiousity Mars Rover and projects them into a 360 degree space. Along with little notes and tidbits about the rover and the project. I think this is a great way to bring space to the masses in a way that lets them experience it firsthand. in a small way.

Try the Access Mars project [here](https://accessmars.withgoogle.com/).

# Artist's Work - No Man's Sky

![Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/nintendo-europe-noe-sherpa/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,h_1080,q_auto,w_1920/v1/NAL/Software%20Nintendo%20Switch/No%20Man's%20Sky/No_Mans_Sky_Hero)

No Man's Sky is a game with impossible scope. [18 quintillion](https://gamerant.com/no-mans-sky-how-many-planets-explained/) procedurally generated planets to explore at your leisure, filled with flora and fauna. The scale of this game is impossible to comprehend. Depsite some [controversy](https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/jul/20/no-mans-sky-next-hello-games-sean-murray-harassment-interview) early in it's life, it has since been [turned around](https://www.tweaktown.com/news/81055/no-mans-sky-one-of-gamings-best-comeback-stories-turns-five-today/index.html) to become a fan favourite.

I bring it up because it is [VR compatible](https://www.polygon.com/2019/8/15/20806094/no-mans-sky-beyond-pc-vr-impressions-rift-s-index-psvr). That changes the game. Literally.

Seeing a universe on a monitor is one thing. Being _inside_ it. Walking around the planets you land on. Flying through space in the cockpit of a spaceship and hearing the engines roar as you fly into a station. It's unbelievably immersive. Immersion is a pretty big [focus](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/258734.258744) for Virtual Reality, and this experience, quite literally, sent me to another world.

# Artist's Work - _Inside_ by Bo Burnham

![Image](https://images.mubicdn.net/images/film/307199/cache-682781-1622612528/image-w1280.jpg)

The pandemic was a difficult time for many. Being locked away in isolation, unable to safely interact with friends, family, and the world at large was a huge shift for many. Not to even mention those who lost their lives or loved ones to the pandemic. To say that it was the defining event for many lives is undeniable. Naturally, this event had an effect on art and creative expression.

Notable comedian, musician and [director](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighth_Grade_(film)) [Bo Burnham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo_Burnham) made waves in 2021 when he released his Netflix "comedy" special [Inside](https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/may/31/bo-burnham-inside-review-netflix), a look into the psyche of someone locked away forced to create content. Known for his live comedy specials, and then for taking a hiatus to focus on his mental health, having to move to this medium was a a bittersweet form of return to comedy.

And it was profound, introspective, and raw. The entire special was full of emotion, insight, and existential dread. The show is a masterpiece, although I would link it closer to performance art than pure comedy. 

Of all the many brilliant songs contained within such as [Welcome to the Internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1BneeJTDcU) and [All Eyes On Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Rx_p3NW7gQ), it was [That Funny Feeling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObOqq1knVxs) that stuck with me the most. It best encapuslaed the sort of existential anxiety that permeated that time for many, myself included at times. It had a sense of nostalgia, mourning, powerlessness and, I don't know, it just hit hard. It's a song I listen to often, almost as if to help me experience feelings I didn't know I had buried.

It's a song that has helped me conceptualise my Virtual Reality Project, but more on that in another post.

# VR Time Capsule - Project Tether - Part 1

Welcome to the culmination of _weeks_ of Immersive Media work. Welcome to the concoction of a tired mind. Welcome, to **Project Tether**.

The idea? Simple.

The brief? Engaging.

The music? Vibing.

The creator? Sleepy.

Okay, in all seriousness, this is a time capsule project. Two parts, capturing a location with a [360 degree camera](https://www.insta360.com/product/insta360-onex2) as a sort of time capsule of that space, and then a VR alternate reality of sorts. My idea is to capture my bedroom (very imaginative, I know), but it's required for the parallel world.

The parallel world is a dream state. Not quite real, not quite possible, but it is the same location. Or rather, it's the same location _in spirit._ A bedroom is a haven from the world (or it could be an inescapable prison thanks to a global pandemic, but lets stick with haven for now) where someone can be themself, express themself through their gathered knickknacks and decorations. Just be.

But I also want this project to be a culmination of what I've been working on so far. So the parallel world?

Space.

Now, before this sounds like laziness, there is valid reason. One cannot simply exist in space without violent death. Dreams don't follow rules, you can be there in a dream. And I call it Project Tether because of the props. Parts of my bedroom, the bed, monitors, shelves, etc., will be floating around the player as if tethered to their spot as they reside in a quiet, lonely haven in space. Away from the world, away from everything. Insulated. Cozy. Safe.

Additionally, I plan on having music be an important part of this experience. Continuing on from my post on Bo Burnham's _Inside_ I plan on having the song _That Funny Feeling_ playing in both worlds, as if it's being heard from inside the dream and echoing inside. I feel the song, with it's quiet guitar strumming, and the campfire background sounds, will help to provide a cozy, fireside atmosphere mixed with existenstial dread that something is off or different about the dream world.

More to come.

# VR Time Capsule - Project Tether - Part 2

I've been modelling parts of my room. Using [AutoDesk Fusion360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview?term=1-YEAR&tab=subscription), I found the specifications of my bed, monitors, and shelving unit and recreated them to use as models!

I used this really cool freely available [tool](https://tools.wwwtyro.net/space-3d/index.html#animationSpeed=1&fov=80&nebulae=true&pointStars=true&resolution=1024&seed=2i5ixxa0fvs0&stars=true&sun=true) to generate a unique, six-sided space skybox for use with this project. Just starts, no sun, and plugged it into. Worked a treat.

I've got everything into the scene now. The box on the ground seen here in the editor shows the playspace. An invisible box surrounds the play to prevent them from walking off or falling eternally. The sensation of standing on nothing in space is odd, and exactly what I wanted. The objects I modelling, representing the remnants of my room in this dream state float and bob about as if there's zero gravity. I used and then heavily edited [this](http://www.donovankeith.com/tag/csharp/) open source script to get it working. It was very useful. Next up, general improvements and thinking of how the player should switch to the other scene.

# Artist's Work - Outer Wilds
![Image](https://www.psu.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Outer-Wilds-PS4-Wallpapers-02.jpeg)

**Not** to be confused with [The Outer Worlds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outer_Worlds), Outer Wilds is a deeply engrossing puzzle gamew in which the player has 22 minutes before the sun explodes and destroys the solar system, only to wake up and begin the loop again. Each loop will play out identically save for your actions, and will edge you closer to learning why the sun is xploding. It is narratively engaging, charmingly cute, and completely immersive. It's a masterpiece in every sense. 

Additionally, I have to bring up the soundtrack. Composer [Andrew Prahlow](http://www.andrewprahlow.com/) set out to make a soundtrack that is an _"extension of the heart of the game"_. His music focuses on _"larger-than-life, emotive soundscapes with a core of chamber-ensemble minimalism, hoping to create a sense of nostalgia and familiarity for the listener."_

This is perfect for my space scene. An enourmous scene, the sun itself as your lightsource. But a sense of coziness and familiarity. This game is inspiring. This music is inspiring. And it would be criminal to not pay homage to it. I plan to use part of the soundtrack in my piece in conjuction with _That Funny Feeling_ More on that later. 

# VR Time Capsule - Project Tether - Part 4

I wanted my scene to have a dreamlike quality to it. Between the impossible visuals, the accompnaying music, and the atmosphere of being alone floating in space. And I wanted switching to the 360 degree video to feel like waking up. Waking up is often a destructive process for a dream. It becomes hard to remember, fading away. Dreams are ephemeral, temporary, and fleeting. So, in homage to the sun exploding in _Outer Wilds_ waking up from the dream will likewise involve the sun exploding, consuming the dream. 

This works on a few levels. The first is that the dream is literally swallowed up by the sun as it expands, fading it away slowly as the dream is lost to the sensation of being awake. Additionally, most people wake up to daylight. The sun is quite literally the embodiment of daylight, shining in to break up the dream.

I wanted a way to trigger the wake up sequence. I thought about making it on a timer, but this had the chance of someone missing it or not being ready to go. So instead I created a podium with a button using [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPPa9y_czlE) tutorial that, when pressed, triggers the end of the dream. You have to decide when you're ready to leave it behind, but you can't go back. There's no way to re-enter the VR world from the 360 degree video. I wanted to emphasise the temporary and fragile nature of dreams. Being able to re-join whenever seemed contrary to this.

_Press the big red button. Destroy everything._

Additionally, on the podium is the sign "Wake Up". I wrote this to be clear to the player what it would do, and so they wouldn't press it immediately and leave the scene too early. But again, to emphasise the strangeness of the dream, I included a custom script I designed in another class. Seemed a fun use for it.

When the sun explodes, the song [_End Times_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5vG4Be1Ci8) by Andrew Prahlow from the _Outer Wilds_ soundtrack plays, right up until the moment the sun engulfs the player. This was both reference and seemed deeply fitting. The song is slow, gradually building to a point. It was composed for this purpose.

Addtionally, wow, lots in this post, I wanted the sun to go through phases as it grew, signifying a large build up. I designed several materials for the sun that it would switch through until it shone a bright white that covered the screen, right as the player wakes up. It switches through them fairly naturally thanks to help from [this](https://answers.unity.com/questions/217709/fading-between-2-materials.html) and [this](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Material.Lerp.html).

Here is the code I made that achieves this:

```
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class SunExplode : MonoBehaviour
{

    public bool readyToExplode;
    public float speed;
    public float targetSize = 1000.0f;
    public Vector3 scaler = new Vector3(300, 300, 300);
    public Material sun1;
    public Material sun2;
    public Material sun3;
    public Material sun4;
    Renderer rend;
    public float duration = 10.0f;

    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()
    {
        readyToExplode = false;
        scaler.x = 300;
        scaler.y = 300;
        scaler.z = 300;
        rend = GetComponent<Renderer> ();
    }
 
void Update()
{
    transform.localScale = scaler;
    if (readyToExplode) 
    {
        scaler.x = Mathf.Lerp(scaler.x, targetSize, Time.deltaTime / speed);
        scaler.y = Mathf.Lerp(scaler.y, targetSize, Time.deltaTime / speed);
        scaler.z = Mathf.Lerp(scaler.z, targetSize, Time.deltaTime / speed);
    }

    if (scaler.x > 400 && scaler.x < 600) {
        float lerp = Mathf.PingPong(Time.time, duration) / duration;
        rend.material.Lerp(sun1, sun2, lerp);
    }

    if (scaler.x > 600 && scaler.x < 800) {
        float lerp = Mathf.PingPong(Time.time, duration) / duration;
        rend.material.Lerp(sun2, sun3, lerp);
    }

    if (scaler.x > 800) {
        float lerp = Mathf.PingPong(Time.time, duration) / duration;
        rend.material.Lerp(sun3, sun4, lerp);
    }
}

    public void Explode()
    {
        readyToExplode = true;
    }
}
```

Additionally (finally?), thanks to some tester feedback, I added an Earth object closer to the sun that gets engulfed first as the sun expands. Partially this continues the theme of the dream_world_ being erased slowly. But it also helps show the sun approached by removing objects as it gets closer. The sun gets so large scale can be hard to tell at times.

While the sun uses the same textures as in Project Stellar, the Earth here has night textures straight from [NASA](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/NightLights/page3.php). I also reused the planet spinning code from my last project, but tweaked it a little here and there.
