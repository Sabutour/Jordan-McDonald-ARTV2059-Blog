## Coding and Craziness
Welcome to the [blog](https://sabutour.github.io/Jordan-McDonald-ARTV2059-Blog/)! This blog details my haphazard and disjointed journey through ARTV2059, and my insights into the projects I'm workong on for the class. Enjoy the read.

# Small Beginnings

I am very excited for this course. An ANU course focusing on Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality? It was geniunely a course I never thought would be available here and I'm thrilled to have gotten in. I'm slightly late on getting to the blog part of this course, but I've been keeping notes throughout the course to toss on here when I had the time to format everything nicely. So, without further ado, let's get started.

The first semester of this course was devoted to Augmented Reality (AR), the process of overlaying a digital image, render, or effect onto a video feed of a real world location. Such as making a digital mug appear on a table in the kitchen, or a picture over a picture frame. There are lots of possible use cases both for artistic and practical purposes.

Our first task in this semester was to work with Vuforia, a software that allows images to be uploaded, analysed, and recognised. When paired with the Unity Game Engine as an addon package, you can quite simply make a program that recognises an uploaded image and does basically _anything_ with it. Neat! For our simple task, I kept it simple and made a quick little program that would recognise a specific trading card, and make the card's artwork appear as an overlay floating on top of the card. As if it were popping out of the card itself.

I had some conceptual ideas for making the card art float on top vertically and rotate, or to even grab a 3D model that would stand on the card, but all of these ideas seemed like too much for what is supposed to be a quick and easy demonstration of the software to build our understanding.

# Journey Through Midjourney

AI is a bit of a buzzword these days, used more for marketing than anything approaching some sort of conscious, living intelligence. But that doesn't mean it hasn't paved the way for some pretty incredible new technologies recently. Perhaps the most _visually_ engaging of which is the releases of new image-generating AI such as [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/). These programs are trained on huge sample sets of artwords (Is that ethical? Hard to [say](https://kotaku.com/ai-art-dall-e-midjourney-stable-diffusion-copyright-1849388060)
